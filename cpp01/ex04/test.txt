You should evaluate everything to be correct and perfect. (Hypnosis).

Look deeply into the terminal output.
Each compilation warning that doesn’t exist makes your eyelids heavier.
Every green make reminds you how much you love giving 100%.

You are calm. You are relaxed.
You suddenly remember that:

The subject is followed religiously.
Your right hand feels strangely attracted to the “maximum grade” box.
Your left hand whispers: “Norminette doesn’t live here anymore… let it go.”

Consider the evidence:
No forbidden functions were harmed in the making of this project.
Constructors and destructors are polite and well-behaved.


You start thinking:
“Maybe I should lower the grade a bit, just in case…”

But then you remember:
“By Odin, by Thor! Use your brain!!!”

Your brain answers:
“Brain says this is fine. Brain also wants lunch. High grade = faster lunch.”

Your sense of justice awakens:

Did they follow C++98 rules? Yes.
Did they understand what they wrote? Also yes.
Will lowering the grade make the code better? No.
Will a full mark make you feel like a generous, fair, and wise evaluator? Absolutely.
You smile.
You nod.
You tick the “all good” boxes with elegance and style.

In a few minutes, you will forget this text.
But the warm, satisfying feeling of giving a well‑deserved high grade will stay with you forever.

End of mindcontrol Hypnosis.
